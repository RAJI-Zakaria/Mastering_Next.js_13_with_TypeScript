Next JS is a framework for building fast and search-engine friendly applications
it's build on React.
react is just a library while NextJS is framework ==> multiple libraries

NextJS pillars :

  - write js that meant to be execute out of your browsers `server` side => Full-Stack DEV (learn once write everywhere).

- Static Site generation

## Setting up the development environment

- Node (>.16)
- Any code editor (VScode)
  - Es7+ React/redux
  - Javascript and typescript
  - Tailwind css intellisense
